# eye-cataract-classification
The purpose of this project is to classify eye images into categories based on the presence of cataract. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the course on Image Analysis and Recognition (IAAA) event.  
The project will involve preprocessing the images by cropping and applying data augmentation techniques. The machine learning models used for this project will be implemented using scikit-learn and Keras libraries.  
**Tools**: The following tools will be used for this project:  
•	Python: for implementation of the code.  
•	scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.  
•	Keras: for deep learning models.  
•	OpenCV: for image preprocessing.  

**Data Preprocessing**: The images in the dataset will be preprocessed to enhance their quality and reduce noise. The images will be cropped to remove any unwanted background and focus on the eye region. Data augmentation techniques will be applied to increase the size of the dataset and improve the robustness of the model. Some of the data augmentation techniques that will be applied include rotation, flipping, and zooming.  

**Machine Learning**: The machine learning model will be developed using scikit-learn and Keras. The scikit-learn library will be used for traditional machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The Keras library will be used for deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  

**Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The models will be evaluated using cross-validation techniques to ensure the validity of the results.  

**Output**: The output of the project will be a classification model that can accurately classify eye images into categories based on the presence of cataract. The output will be in the form of a trained model that can be used for future predictions.  

**GitHub**: The code and data for this project will be uploaded to GitHub for easy access and sharing. The code will be well-documented to make it easy for other users to understand and use.
